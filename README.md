# source-detection
The Python code for the experiments in the AAMAS-26 paper: Identifying the Source of Information Spread in Networks via Markov Chains.

First version (by Yael Sabato):

Second version (by Roni EngelVorst and Hadar Froimowich):  
https://github.com/RoniEngelVorst/Source_Detection/  
(They added top-3 and distance-3 metrics, and adapted the no-loops method for the k-sources problem)  

In the current version, I fixed some bugs, optimized the code, and integrated the MCMC algorithm. The code is still messy...
When I have some time, I plan to clean up and organize the code.
